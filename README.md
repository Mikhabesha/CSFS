The Customer Service Follow-Up System (CSFS) is a project developed for an organization to manage and track 
the process of pensioners from start to finish. It is designed to handle the whereabouts and follow-up of pensioners,
ensuring that their needs are met and that the process is efficiently managed. The system likely includes features
such as tracking pensioners' information, monitoring their progress through the pension process, and providing necessary support
and assistance as needed. Overall, the CSFS aims to streamline and improve customer service for pensioners within the nation.
